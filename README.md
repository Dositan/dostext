# DosText: The code editor of the future.
### How to use DosText?
The application is really easy to understand since it is written in style like Windows Notepad.

### Plans
I am planning to create a great code|text editor to be able to manage my coding projects only there.
Creating GUI's is such an awesome experience, this requires patience also.

### How can I run it on my own?
This is really simple. Download or clone the repository, navigate to the project folder (`cd dostext`) and run as a module (`python -m dostext`), and you are ready to go.
